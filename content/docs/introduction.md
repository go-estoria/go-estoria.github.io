## What is Event Sourcing?

Event sourcing is a technique by which an entity's state is persisted as a series of immutable events. These events are loaded and replayed in-order to reconstruct the entity's state.

## What is Estoria?

Estoria is an event sourcing toolkit for Go, comprised of components that handle the details of loading and saving event-sourced entites.
