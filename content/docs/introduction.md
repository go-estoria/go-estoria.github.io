## What is Estoria?

Estoria is an event sourcing toolkit for Go, comprised of components that enable the loading and saving event-sourced entites.

Event sourcing is a technique by which an entity's state is persisted as a series of immutable events. These events are loaded and replayed in-order to reconstruct the entity's state.

## Getting Started

See the [Getting Started](../getting_started) guide to learn how to use Estoria in your Go project.
